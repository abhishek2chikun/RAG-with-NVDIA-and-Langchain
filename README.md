## RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with NVIDIA and Langchain

This application empowers users to upload PDF documents and leverage the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ask and receive insightful answers directly from those documents. The core functionalities are underpinned by:

NVIDIA AI Endpoints: Providing access to state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and APIs.
Langchain: Facilitating efficient Q&A prompts and document processing workflows.
Streamlit: Enabling a user-friendly and interactive interface.
Key Features:

Effortless Document Processing: Upload and store your PDF documents with ease.
Local File Management: Optionally save uploaded documents locally for further analysis.
Advanced Vector Embeddings: Employ NVIDIA's vector embedding capabilities and the FAISS library to optimize search and retrieval.
Comprehensive Question Answering: Pose complex questions related to the uploaded documents, and the RAG model will generate relevant and accurate responses.
